    "\n",
    ">You will work to write several functions that investigate a dataset of 'Jeopardy!' questions and answers. Filter the dataset for topics that you’re interested in, compute the average difficulty of those questions, and train to become the next Jeopardy champion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Requirements\n",
    ">We’ve provided a csv file containing data about the game show 'Jeopardy!' in a file named `jeopardy.csv`. Load the data into a DataFrame and investigate its contents. Try to print out specific columns.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Note that in order to make this project as \"real-world\" as possible, we haven’t modified the data at all — we’re giving it to you exactly how we found it. As a result, this data isn’t as \"clean\" as the datasets you normally find on Codecademy. More specifically, there’s something odd about the column names. After you figure out the problem with the column names, you may want to rename them to make your life easier the rest of the project."
